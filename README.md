# C.I.A.R.A.

Cal's Intelligent And Responsive Automaton is my custom discord bot that is built using Node.js (previously Python).

## Functionality

Ciara's functionality will expand over time. Currently she supports the following:

- Music
- Leveling system based on message count
- Welcome messages
- Giving new users a role

## Hosting

I originally hosted the bot on my own raspberry pi but have since moved it over to an AWS EC2 server.

## Discord.js

Discord.js is a Discord API wrapper I utilized.

The documentation can be found [here](https://discord.js.org/#/).
